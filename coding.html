			<h1>Coding</h1>
			<p>I’ve been using computers for most of my life, but it wasn’t until my adolescence that programming sparked my interest. Although difficult at first, it has since become something I do every day.</p>
			<p>Programming is a useful skill that will only become more powerful. Computers have come a long way, and today a small device can add billions of numbers, outthink the smartest humans, and even create art. Computer programs have let us do things we used to only dream of, and learning how to create and manipulate them puts the power into your hands. Programming is truly the way of the future, a power you would be wise to use.</p>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>Though I have taken Computer Science at my high school up to the university level, a lot of my knowledge has come from other places. I taught my self the basics of programming in 8th grade by reading books from the library. Throughout the year, I experimented and tried writing code to do various tasks. In 2017, I signed up for extracurricular programming classes, which I continued to take until my graduation from high school.</p>
			<p>From 9th grade onwards, I began taking computer science at school. Although I was also taking extracurricular lessons at the time, through these courses I got experience in a variety of different programming languages, including Turing, Python, Java, C, and C++. I also learned the basics of computer hardware and how to create a website using HTML.</p>
			<p>I often do practice questions online at DMOJ.com. <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/discoverMe">Here is a link to my account.</a></p>
			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<h3>CCC</h3>
			<p>Ah, the Canadian Computing Competition, the one thing that defines every programmer’s existence. Each year, the most perceptive hackers ready their mechanical keyboards, dark themed IDEs, and birth programming language to engage in a fearsome battle of code errors, bugs, and cursing at computers.</p>
			<p>Just kidding, programmers don’t leave the house.</p>
			<p>There are 2 difficulty levels for the CCC: the junior division and the senior division. Each consists of 5 problems, for each of which one must write a program to perform a task. In 2017, I came in 1st place in the junior division. In 2019, I entered the CCC senior division and placed 63rd. </p>

			<h3>Programming Club</h3>
			<p>In addition to creating programs, through high school I also enjoyed helping others from my school improve their own programming skills. As programming club leader, I helped manage the club, register our school for contests, and teach new members.</p>

			<h3>ECOO</h3>
			<p>In 2019, I and 3 other students from my school went to the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario (ECOO) Programming Contest. we advanced to the second round where we finished 7th.</p>
			<p>Unlike the CCC, students in the ECOO solve problems as teams. Although we were put against teams from all over Ontario, through teamwork and planning we were able to succeed. Everyone did their own part, whether it was thinking of solutions, writing code, or creating test cases. It was a great experience and I am honoured to be part of the team.</p>

			<h1>Math</h1>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Academics</h2>
			<p>I have currently taken math up to the IB high level (equivalent to AP or first-year university). I have also taken the Math 2 SAT subject test and scored a full 800 points.</p>
			<h2>Math contests</h2>
			<h3>Euclid Math contest</h3>
			<p>The Euclid math contest, hosted by Waterloo University, is taken by over 20000 students every year. On this contest, you must answer questions with full, well-organized solutions. </p>
			<h3>AMC and AiME</h3>
			<p>In 2019 I participated in the American Mathematics Competition (AMC 10). I scored in the top 2.5% for both the A and B contests, advancing to the second round, the AIME, where I scored</p>
			<h3>COMC</h3>
