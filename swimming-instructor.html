			<h1>Swimming Instructor</h1>
			<p class="subh">Sept 2017 - Mar 2018</p>
			<p>In the summer of 2017, I had been doing competitive swimming for a few years. My club also taught swimming lessons after our practices, so our coach asked some of us older kids to help teach. I had recently gotten the Bronze Cross lifeguard certificate and I was able to volunteer.</p>
			<p>For the first week I followed an instructor, and the next week, I was assigned, my own class. For the first session, I taught a group of beginners, consisting of 6 children aged 4-8. I was given instructions and material to introduce but I was free to decide the lessons. It was also my responsibility to ensure the childrenâ€™s safety, adjust for their learning speeds, and help them if they were upset, tired, or scared of the water. After 3 months the session ended and I taught a new class.</p>
