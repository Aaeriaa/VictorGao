			<h1>FIRST robotics team</h1>
			<p class="subh">Sep 2017 - Jun 2019</p>
			<p>In grade 9 I joined the robotics team at my school. The purpose of the team was to build a robot to participate in the FIRST<sup>Â®</sup> Robotics Competition (FRC). More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST</a> or <a href="https://www.firstroboticscanada.org/frc/">FIRST CANADA</a> website.</p>
			<p>Because I had no prior experience, I, along with the other new members, spent the first months being taught the rules and the basics of building a robot. After the winter, a new competition season began and the whole team met to suggest ideas and create a plan. Over the next 6 weeks, we built the robot, each doing a part and working on the frame, parts, electronics, or even helping taking pictures or making posters. By working together we managed to complete the robot by the deadline.</p>
			<p>Although we had built the robot, there was still much to be done during a competition, including driving the robot, making repairs, forming alliances with other teams, and showing team spirit. Throughout the season we went to several competitions, advancing to the provincial round.</p>
			<p>The next school year I went with the team to another competition as well as help host our own competition at our school. After that, we disassembled the robot and when the new season started in 2019, we began the process again.</p>
			<p>The experience seemed repetitive, following the same procedure every year. I also felt the team had become too large and disorganized. Because of this, I eventually lost interest in FIRST robotics and put my time elsewhere.</p>
