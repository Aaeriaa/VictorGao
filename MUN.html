			<h1>Model United Nations Club</h1>
			<p class="subh">Sep 2017 - Jun 2021</p>

			<p>To practice my ability to communicate and cooperate with others, I joined the Model United Nations (MUN) club. In this club we simulate a United Nations meeting, roleplaying as delegates to debate and find solutions to a topic. In addition to learning about world issues and the UN, this club helps develop speaking, debating, and teamwork skills.</p>

			<p>After teaching us new members the basics, we continued to practice and discuss different topics during our weekly club meetings. In April, I participated in the Don Mills MUN conference, a conference with students all over the city where we were judged and awarded based on our performance, and was came in 4th place in my committee.</p>
			<p>In 10th grade I was made a club executive and it was my turn to teach the new members. At the start of the previous year, many members felt that MUN was too difficult and quit the club. Learning from this, I made the lessons very simple and easy to understand, helping retain more of the members. In December many of them were ready and we went to another conference.</p>
			<p>Now that our club had more members,</p>
