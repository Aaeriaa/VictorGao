			<h1>Peer Tutoring</h1>
			<p class="subh">Oct 2016 - May 2017</p>
			<p>In my 8th grade, I joined my school's peer tutoring program, where struggling students could get help from older students who volunteered. Many of the students only needed a little help with their homework, but after about a month, I was assigned to a girl in 7th grade who was having a lot of difficulties. Although I knew all of the school material, I quickly found out it was not enough. It was just as important to be able to come up with different explanations so she could understand and to make her hopeful and motivated to improve. I was her tutor for the rest of the school year, and throughout the experience, I learned a lot about communicating with other people, especially younger children.</p>
