			<p>From 2017 to 2018 I was in the Junior Achievement (JA) Company program. Together with others in the group (the division in Scarborough, sponsored by TD) and 3 adult advisors, we created and ran our own company.</p>
			<p>In the first 2 weeks, the advisors introduced us to the program and taught the basics of running a business. We came up with ideas for our product and decided to sell hoodies. We then picked our company’s president and vice presidents, and everyone was divided into a department. I was chosen as the VP of marketing.</p>
			<p>Afterward, we created our company and everyone contributed $25 of their own money in exchange for a company share. Next, we planned out the rest of the year and scheduled our weekly meetings. We also created a logo and mission statement for our company. For the rest of the program, we ran our company. We assigned individual jobs or worked together to promote our company, buy materials for a low cost, find customers, produce and deliver our products, and more. </p>
			<p>Our company was unsuccessful at first, losing over $200 by January. The market for clothing was very competitive, and most people would rather buy their hoodies at the mall, from a popular brand. It was too late to change our product, but we needed a way to stand out. We named the company “Inclusion”, and put our positive messages on the front of the hoodies, we selling our hoodies as something one could wear to victims of bullying and the inclusion of minority groups. In addition, we got more customers by selling online through Facebook, Instagram, and our own company website.</p>

			<p>Another problem we faced was that our company had only 13 members, much less than most other JA companies. At the start of the year, 25 people joined the program, but many quit within the first month. To make the most out of our time, although we were assigned our own jobs, we often helped do work in other company departments. </p>
			<p>Later in March and April were a number of special events. We created a video commercial for the JA “battle of the ads”, and I went with 2 others to a JA tradeshow where we set up a stand to sell our products. We also wrote a shareholders report summarizing what we did that year.</p>
			<p>In May we had our last meeting before liquidating the company. By working hard and overcoming our challenges we were able to make a profit, even after the $250 dollar fee to JA.  We did not earn as much as some other groups or win any awards but through this program, I gained valuable experience in all areas of business and running a company.</p>
