			<h1>Swimming Instructor</h1>
			<p class="inlineh">Sep 2017 - Mar 2018</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.chacoaquatic.com">Chaco Swim</a></p>
			<p>In the summer of 2017, I had been doing competitive swimming for a few years. My club also taught swimming lessons after our practices, so I decided to help out and volunteer.</p>
			<p>For the first week I followed an instructor, and the next week, I was assigned, my own class. For the first session, I taught a group of beginners, consisting of 6 children aged 4-8. I was given instructions and material to introduce but I was free to decide the lessons. It was also my responsibility to ensure the children’s safety, adjust for their learning speeds, and help them if they were upset or scared. After 3 months the session ended and I taught a new class.</p>

			<h1>DECA</h1>
			<p>DECA competitive events are business-themed competitions. Participants are tested on their skills in marketing, administration, and finance by taking an exam and roleplaying in a realistic business scenario. In 2017, I placed in the top 10 for both the exam and the case study at the Regional (citywide) competitions. I advanced to provincials where I was top 20 on the exam. Preparing and practicing for the event taught me more about businesses and how to act in a professional environment.</p>

			<h1>Swimming</h1>
			<p>Swimming is one of my favorite hobbies. I’ve been swimming 4 or 5 times every week since I was 12 years old. In addition to swimming at practices, I also go with my team to compete at swim meets.</p>
			<p>Although I swim very often, I have yet to qualify for the provincials. Still, swimming is a form of exercise and good for my mental health. And above all, the feeling you get when you put in all you’ve got, persevere on, and swim faster than you ever have - that's what makes it all worth it.</p>

			<h1>JA company program</h1>
			<p class="inlineh">Oct 2017 - May 2018</p>
			<p>Shareholder and Vice President of Marketing</p>
			<p>From 2017 to 2018 I was in the Junior Achievement (JA) Company program. Together with other high-school students (the division in Scarborough, sponsored by TD) and 3 professional advisors, we created and ran our own company. </p>
			<p>My activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Decided to sell hoodies after coming up with ideas for products</li>
				<li>Chose the president and vice presidents of the company through a vote</li>
				<li>Collected a 25$ investment from each member for a company share</li>
				<li>Created a company name, logo, and mission statement</li>
				<li>Planned out the year and scheduled regular company meetings</li>
				<li>Assigned individual jobs or worked together to promote the company, buy materials, find customers, produce and deliver products</li>
				<li>Created a website to promote our product</li>
				<li>Managed the company’s social media accounts</li>
				<li>Created a video commercial for the JA “battle of the ads”</li>
				<li>I attended a JA tradeshow with 2 others and set up a stand to promote and sell our products</li>
				<li>Wrote a shareholders report summarizing what we did each month</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Throughout our operations, we faced many challenges and disadvantages. Our company only had 13 members, which was less than most groups, so we had to be efficient and make the most out of our time. The market for clothing was very competitive, and most people would rather buy hoodies from more popular brands. In order to stand out, we named our company “Inclusion” and sold hoodies with positive messages on them, that one could wear to show support to minority groups or stand up to bullying. We also increased the demand for our products by selling online through facebook, Instagram, and our own company website. </p>
			<p>Although we were initially unsuccessful, we eventually managed to make a profit, even after paying the $250 dollar tax to JA. We did not earn enough to win any awards, but I gained valuable experience in all areas of business and running a company.</p>
