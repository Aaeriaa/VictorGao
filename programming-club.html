			<h1>Programming Club</h1>
			<p class="subh">Mar 2018 - Jun 2021</p>
			<img alt="activity picture" class="i51" src="images/bg1.jpg">
			<p>Participating in the 2018 Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) introduced me to members of our school’s programming club.  I joined the club to compete in the ECOO team programming contest and helped our school place 7th out of 21 schools, advancing to the second round.</p>
			<h3>A new year</h3>
			<p>After the summer, I was selected as one of the club’s new leaders. Our first task was to find a new club supervisor for the school year, as the previous teacher had moved to a different school. Next, we made announcements and a booth for our school’s club fair to attract new members. By our first meeting, we had gained over 20 people.</p>
			<p>To help our school perform better at competitions, we taught programming lessons during our meetings. We split the members into 2 groups, those who were new or needed help on their homework, and those who were experienced and could be introduced to topics above the level taught at school and taught them separately. This proved to be a success by the time we took the 2019 CCC in February.</p>
